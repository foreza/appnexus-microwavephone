# appnexus-microwavephone

This is a project that demonstrates usage of the AppNexus Android SDK and the AerServ AppNexus plugin to mediate.



## COMPONENTS/RESOURCES
### AppNexus Android SDK
The primary SDK being used to fill ad placements is AppNexus.

:warning: Be advised that currently, we're unable to fully test this integration as we do not have sample credentials. We have several applicaton publishers using this route (integrating AppNexus + AerServ plugin), and our plugin is made possible through their efforts.
